# CCEIC-Discord-bot

### How to use it:
To use the bot the user must type `/start` and it will show a list of modules. To select the desired module the user can use the arrow keys or select it with the mouse. After selecting it just the user may press the return key so the interaction begins. Each module starts by showing a brief description of it, a video, and reference links. When the user feels comfortable with the subject he can press the `Next` button so the preparation questions begin. The user can then answer these questions and when done he may repeat them by pressing `I need to practice again...` or advance to the evaluation questions by pressing the `Let's go!` button. The user then answers the evaluation questions. At the end a score is given and if a fun fact exists it is also shown. The user can then repeat the evaluation questions by pressing `I'll have another go` or go to the beginning of the module by pressing `Restart Module (go back to the very beginning)`. At any moment the user may also choose another module by typing `/start` and choosing it.
