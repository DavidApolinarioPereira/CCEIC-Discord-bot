  With the amount of communication tools on the market, it is hard to pick one. "The difficulty is in finding the ones that are more than just tools for tools sake, and then using them in a way that solves real employee problems" (Screencloud, 2022). Here, we list three tools (plus a bonus) one can use for Internal Communication.
  1. Online Forums: Using a forum helps communicating and discussing ideas. Although it is more informal, it can help when ideas need to be discussed with more than one colleague (Screencloud, 2022).
  2. Instant messaging tools: Instant messaging tools are a quick way to communicate with colleagues in a company, especially if we quickly need a response from someone, such as a Team Leader (Duncan, 2022). It is not recomended for big group discussions.
  3. Video Chat: Video chatting tools can be useful for longer discussions, as it helps with the visual communication of ideas (Duncan, 2022).
  4. (Bonus): Despite being a dying breed (unfortunately), emails are still one of the main communication methods. They can be used to send newsletters or important work notifications to a group of employees within a company. Beware, however, of email overload, which may result in missing more information in the first place (Duncan, 2022).
  Using the right tool for the right job is also very important. If you want to communicate something quickly, scheduling a video call might take too long. Instead, consider sending a message. Most importantly: Use a tool that properly notifies people.
