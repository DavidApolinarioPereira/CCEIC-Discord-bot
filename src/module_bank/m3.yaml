  There are several types of questions. This module will highlight four different types.

  **Open Questions**
  “An open ended question is designed to encourage a full, meaningful, and deliberate answer using the subject's own knowledge and/or feelings” (Formplus Blog, 2021b).
  Open Questions have several use cases, for example, asking for details, assessing deep knowledge on a subject, building rapport, etc.

  **Closed Questions**
  “Close-ended questions are question formats that provoke a simple response from a respondent. They are designed such there (sic) isn’t much thought into the single word answer”. (Formplus Blog, 2021a)
  “Individuals generally enjoy talking about themselves. If you give then an opportunity, you'll be surprised how much information they'll disclose to you. However, close-ended questions seek the exact opposite. Rather than seek to hear all they have to say, these questions target specifics.” (Formplus Blog, 2021a)

  **Probing Questions**
  Probing questions are open questions “designed to deepen the knowledge and understanding of information for the person asking the question as well as the person answering”. (Indeed Editorial Team, 2021b)
  Probing questions have several use cases, namely, promoting critical thinking, uncovering secrets, facilitating brainstorming, etc.

  **Leading Questions**
  A leading question is a type of question that prompts a respondent towards providing an already-determined answer. This type of question is suggestive as it is framed in such a way that it implies or points to its answer(s). (Formplus Blog, 2021d)

  **Types of Leading Questions**
  *Assumption Based Leading Questions*
  This type of Leading Question stems from an assumption from the interrogator. It is commonly applied to feedback surveys where the objective is to test a given assumption. An example of this could be: “How satisfied are you with our product?”, where the interrogator assumes that a given customer must have been satisfied up to a certain degree.

  *Direct Implication Leading Questions*
  These question types often ask for the respondents opinion on something. Typically, these are focused on a future occurrence or event. An example could be:
  “If you enjoyed the restaurant’s space, would you recommend it to your friends?”. It often implies the respondents directly and can make the respondents feel like a key part of a decision.

  *Coercive Leading Questions (in other words, Forceful)*
  This questioning type almost suggests a forceful answer, given its structure and makes the respondent feel inclined to answer in a certain manner. An example of this could be: “You enjoyed our services, didn't you?”, where the interrogator is expecting a positive answer to his question.
