    There are several types of questions. This module will highlight four different types.

    **Open Questions**
    “An open ended question is designed to encourage a full, meaningful, and deliberate answer using the subject's own knowledge and/or feelings”[2].
    Open Questions have several use cases, for example, asking for details, assessing deep knowledge on a subject, building rapport, etc.

    **Closed Questions**
    “Close-ended questions are question formats that provoke a simple response from a respondent. They are designed such there (sic) isn’t much thought into the single word answer”.[3]
    “Individuals generally enjoy talking about themselves. If you give then an opportunity, you'll be surprised how much information they'll disclose to you. However, close-ended questions seek the exact opposite. Rather than seek to hear all they have to say, these questions target specifics.”[4]

    **Probing Questions**
    Probing questions are open questions “designed to deepen the knowledge and understanding of information for the person asking the question as well as the person answering”.[5]
    Probing questions have several use cases, namely, promoting critical thinking, uncovering secrets, facilitating brainstorming, etc.

    **Leading Questions**
    A leading question is a type of question that prompts a respondent towards providing an already-determined answer. This type of question is suggestive as it is framed in such a way that it implies or points to its answer(s).

    **Types of Leading Questions**
    *Assumption Based Leading Questions*
    This type of Leading Question stems from an assumption from the interrogator. It is commonly applied to feedback surveys where the objective is to test a given assumption. An example of this could be: “How satisfied are you with our product?”, where the interrogator assumes that a given customer must have been satisfied up to a certain degree.

    *Direct Implication Leading Questions*
    These question types often ask for the respondents opinion on something. Typically, these are focused on a future occurrence or event. An example could be:
    “If you enjoyed the restaurant’s space, would you recommend it to your friends?”. It often implies the respondents directly and can make the respondents feel like a key part of a decision.

    *Coercive Leading Questions (in other words, Forceful)*
    This questioning type almost suggests a forceful answer, given its structure and makes the respondent feel inclined to answer in a certain manner. An example of this could be: “You enjoyed our services, didn't you?”, where the interrogator is expecting a positive answer to his question.
