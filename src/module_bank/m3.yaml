  Internal communication has become increasingly important for companies, as it "affects employee engagement, customer satisfaction, and the overall public perception of an organization. That's why the inability to see the dangers of common internal communication challenges looms like an iceberg threatening to sink everyone's corporate Titanic." (Staffbase GmbH, 2016). Here, we list 3 challenges of internal communication. 
  - Lack of Feedback: Communication is an exchange and, as such, information should flow both ways for it to be effective. This is where Feedback is important. Feedback allows people to grow and makes activities more enjoyable by motivating people. (Staffbase GmbH, 2016)
  - Lack of Clear Communication method: Having a clearly defined communication method is important for information sharing. If information is scattered across platforms, it might be hard to keep track of work. (Radworth, 2020)
  - Lack of Mutual Respect: Diversity can be hard to manage when employees cannot relate to each other, as they cannot fathom each other’s experiences. (Staffbase GmbH, 2016)
