  There are several types of questions. This module will highlight four different types.
  **Open Questions**
  “An open ended question is designed to encourage a full, meaningful, and deliberate answer using the subject's own knowledge and/or feelings” (Formplus Blog, 2021b).
  They can be used when asking for details, assessing deep knowledge on a subject, building rapport, etc.
  **Closed Questions**
  “Close-ended questions are question formats that provoke a simple response from a respondent. They are designed such there (sic) isn’t much thought into the single word answer”. (Formplus Blog, 2021a)
  “Individuals generally enjoy talking about themselves. [...] You'll be surprised how much information they'll disclose to you. However, close-ended questions seek the exact opposite.” (Formplus Blog, 2021a)
  **Probing Questions**
  Probing questions are open questions “designed to deepen the knowledge [...] of information for the person asking the question as well as the person answering”. (Indeed Editorial Team, 2021b)
  They can be used for promoting critical thinking, facilitating brainstorming, etc.
  **Leading Questions**
  A leading question is a type of question that prompts a respondent towards providing an already-determined answer. This type of question is suggestive, it implies or points to its answer(s). (Formplus Blog, 2021d)
