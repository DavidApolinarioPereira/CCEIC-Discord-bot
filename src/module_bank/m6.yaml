  A particular case of communication is instant messaging. Here, we list 3 good practices of internal communication in instant messaging:
  - Start with a short greeting: "When starting a conversation with someone over IM, you should always say "hi" or "hello" and then check to make sure it's a good time for them to chat" (Giang, 2013).
  - Don’t ask to ask: In group messages it's better to include your question. "Someone who is idling on the channel and only every now and then glances what's going on is unlikely to answer to your "asking to ask" question, but your actual problem description may pique their interest and get them to answer." (Asokan, n.d.). That said, it’s always good to follow the preference of the receiver. "You should adjust your style of communication to meet the other person’s, whether they are colleagues, bosses, customers, or clients" (Giang, 2013).
  - Focus on one topic: IM is used for quick, laser-focused, correspondence, not long conversations (Advanced Etiquette, 2014). If you need to discuss a broad topic, or want to chit-chat, it’s better to schedule a meeting or drop by in person.
evaluationQuestions:
  - question: How should I start my message?
    correctAnswers:
      - "Hey, do you have a minute? I need to discuss something with you."
      - "Hi! If you’re not too busy, could you please help me with something I'm working on? Thanks for the help!"
    wrongAnswers:
      - "I think your presentation was great!"
      - "I noticed you’re online. Answer my riddle: (...)"
    feedbackForCorrect: You nailed it! Just keep in mind that although most will understand that desire to be respectful of the other’s time, do keep in mind that there are a lot of people who would rather just receive your whole question right away before committing to answer it.
    feedbackForWrong: Ooops! That’s nice, but you should probably greet the person first. Even if you are complimenting someone, start by saying hello. It goes a long way to improve your communication :).
  - question: You need to gather requirements for the new project. How do you contact your client?
    correctAnswers:
      - Email
      - Meeting
    wrongAnswers:
      - Instant Messaging
    feedbackForCorrect: That is correct! using a method that allows you to properly describe the context is optimal.
    feedbackForWrong: Don't worry, you'll get it next time. Just understand that instant messaging is more appropriate for short and to the point conversations, and therefore not great for the lengthy process of requirements gathering. You can try again. I'm sure you will get it right :)
