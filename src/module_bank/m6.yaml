  Probing questions can be described as open questions “designed to deepen the knowledge and understanding of information for the person asking the question as well as the person answering” (Indeed Editorial Team, 2018)
  Simply put, probing questions are intended to help the speaker think more deeply about the issue at hand. It can be as simple as asking the respondant for an example to help one understand something they have said (Mind Tools Content Team, 2009).
