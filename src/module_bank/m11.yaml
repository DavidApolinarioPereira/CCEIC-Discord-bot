  "A leading question is a type of question that prompts a respondent towards providing an already-determined answer. This type of question [...] implies or points to its answer(s)" (Formplus Blog, 2021)

  There are a few kinds of leading questions (Formplus Blog, 2021):
  - **Assumption-Based** - This type of Leading Question stems from an assumption from the interrogator. It is commonly applied to feedback surveys where the objective is to test a given assumption. An example of this could be: “How satisfied are you with our product?”, where the interrogator assumes that a given customer must have been satisfied up to a certain degree.
  - **Direct Implication** - These question types often ask for the respondents opinion on something. Typically, these are focused on a future occurrence or event. An example could be “If you enjoyed the restaurant’s space, would you recommend it to your friends?”. It often implies the respondents directly and can makes them feel a key part of a decision.
  - **Coercive/Forceful** - This questioning type almost suggests a forceful answer, given its structure and makes the respondent feel inclined to answer in a certain manner. An example of this could be: “You enjoyed our services, didn't you?”, where the interrogator is expecting a positive answer.

funFacts:
  - Leading questions are mainly used by attorneys during trial (Melinkoff, UCLA)
  - “Witness’s attorney, during direct examination, generally may not ask leading questions because then the attorney would be suggesting to the witness what the answer should be”. (Melinkoff, UCLA)
  - “Opposing attorneys, during cross-examination, may freely ask leading questions in order to ‘trick’ the witness in answering, to discover contradictions, or to raise doubts in the minds of the jurors”. (Melinkoff, UCLA)
