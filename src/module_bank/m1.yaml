description: |
  Internal communication is increasingly relevant for organizations, as it improves employee inclusion and contributes to the overall success of the enterprise (FitzPatrick et al., 2017).
  Internal communications can help a company address structural problem areas and promote a culture of trust and openness. It should be regarded as an organizational strategy rather than the duty of a single person (Johnson, 2022).
  A good internal communicator should strive to be open and accurate, while passing clear messages that all employees can understand, avoiding the creation of communication hurdles. It is not as easy job, but a vital one to provide transparency within the company (Green, 2020).
