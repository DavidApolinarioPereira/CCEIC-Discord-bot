  Asking questions is something really important, especially in a work environment. Much of our time is spent asking others for information, clarification of something previously said etc. 
  Therefore, it is important to have some insight on some Questioning Techniques when communicating.
  During the communication process, asking questions helps us (Lane, 2019):
  - Clarifying the Information (A good question "can create an 'aha' moment, which can then lead to inovation" (Cheverie, 2017)).
  - Extract more relevant information
  - Create a focused on what is important for us

  The use of questioning techniques is an important area of verbal communication. By asking questions, you gain answers, understanding, and potentially acceptance for the message sender. 
  You can also stimulate learning and allow for one to drive clearer ideas and create and incentive to act upon a subject.
