description : |
  Paraphrasing, is the act of rewriting a section of text using your own words. It can help you convey the meaning of the presented information in a clearer way. Although the text is written in your own words you should always cite the passage you have utilized.
  Mostly, Paraphrasing is used since the original text we are citing does not coincide with the way we structure our sentences or even with the words we use. This can make it seem like it is out of place.

  A Technique that can be used for Paraphrasing is (Walden University, 2021):
  1. Read the text carefully and understand its meaning. Understanding is very important, since trying to rephrase something we did not understand will never produce good results.
  2. Cover the part of the text that we want to paraphrase and try to reproduce that part by conveying the author's intentions. It is important that we start by writing the text by using our own words, so that we end up with a new text that represents our understanding of the original passage.
  3. Next, one should compare the rephrased text with the original text to see if the author's idea is correctly conveyed.
  4. When we are satisfied with our end result, we also need to include a citation to include all the necessary information about the author and where the text was taken from.

        "Differentiation is a way to encourage equality between the approach and talent of the student (Thompson, 2009). This type of instruction gives students different ways to deal with and grasp information, and for establishing new learning to move on in education (Thompson, 2009)." (Lai, 2021)
    feedbackForCorrect: "Correct. This paraphrasing includes the reference from the original article and also manages to use the correct Paraphrasing techniques"
    feedbackForWrong: "A reference is included, however, this Paraphrasing uses many similar words when compared to the original article. You will get it next time. Feel free to try again!"

      "There is evidence to suggest that newsmakers are becoming particularly savvy about placing items on the media agenda. When, for example, President Reagan was running for his second term, he took a tour to promote his administration's record on environmentalism.
      The tour was full of photo opportunities, including the president's standing on a fishing boat in the Chesapeake Bay and the president's wearing a park ranger's hat at Mammoth Cave, Kentucky." (Severin and Tankard, 1992) (Lai, 2021).

        "Severin and Tankard (1992) noted President Reagan's shaping of news coverage when he ran for reelection in 1984. By posing for a photo opportunity in a boat on the Chesapeake Bay, Reagan, according to Severin and Tankard, aimed to present himself as especially concerned about environmentalism." (Lai, 2021)

    feedbackForCorrect: "Notice the Reference to the original Article is present in the second version. When Paraphrasing, always include References to what you are Paraphrasing."
    feedbackForWrong: "There are two errors with this approach. Notice that there is no Reference in the text. Also, notice how similar the original text is to the paraphrased one."

funFacts:
  - "Here is a cool fact before you go: A study (Landau et. al., 2002) also presented students with rewritten passages from an original paragraph, using Paraphrasing techniques. The students selected the passages they thought were plagiarized. After that, the students were either given no feedback, feedback only, examples only, or feedback with examples. The results showed that either giving students feedback, examples of what a correct solution would be, or both improved the ability for the students to detect plagiarism. So, paraphrasing can reduce plagiarism, isn't that great?"
