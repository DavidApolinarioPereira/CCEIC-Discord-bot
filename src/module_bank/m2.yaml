    In the professional context, the ability to ask questions increases our management abilities. Some of these abilities include (Chisholm, 2020): 
    - Being eager to learn and accepting new ideas and points of view and not letting hierarchy interfere with learning.
    - Eager to engage and pay attention to the response given by our colleagues.
    - Being curious and trying to understand how others see the same situations.
    "When your questions are met with good answers, it adds dimensions to your thought process, allowing you to come up with innovative pivoting plans during a crisis, portray authenticity, or determine ways to support your team during trying times." (Chisholm, 2020)
    Asking questions will also improve group moral in a work envirnoment and helps teams find betters solutions together. People that ask questions are better at building relationships which is key in a work envirnoment.
    During this process we also learn more about our colleagues at work and how to deal with them in the future, also contributing to a productive environment.

    feedbackForWrong: >
      Not bad. However, we would like to point you in a different direction: you should avoid interrupting the speaker, even if it seems like you absolutely need to and feel it is the right point of the conversation to do so. 
      Furthermore, always let the speaker finish before starting to talk. Try to focus on a specific topic instead of just asking generic questions. This will improve your questioning techniques!
