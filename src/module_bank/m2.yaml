    Good Internal Communication can lead to several benefits.
    - The first benefit is employee engagement. Companies with a focus on Internal Communication have higher employee retention, and increase the value given to its customers and shareholders (Baldoni, 2009).
    - Companies may also experience a decrease in security threats when applying Internal Communication. For example, improving the communication channels regarding security briefings, will result in more security-aware employees, more likely to follow and apply the IT policies of the enterprise (Brown, 2021).
    - "Without proper identification and continuous adaptation, you'll be trying to hit a moving target while blindfolded" (Crombach, 2018). Using good internal communication practices, the organization can ensure that its employees are all working towards a collective goal.
