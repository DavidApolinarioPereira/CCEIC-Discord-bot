  “Close-ended questions are question formats that provoke a simple response from a respondent. They are designed such there (sic) isn’t much thought into the single word answer”. (Formplus Blog, 2021)
  “Individuals generally enjoy talking about themselves. If you give then an opportunity, you'll be surprised how much information they'll disclose to you. However, close-ended questions seek the exact opposite. Rather than seek to hear all they have to say, these questions target specifics.” (Formplus Blog, 2021)
  
  When to use closed questions (Question pro, 2019):
  - To obtain specific insight. Contrary to Open Ended Questions, Closed questions make it easier to compare responses.
  - To restrict the response and reduce uncertainty.
