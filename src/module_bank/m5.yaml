  Meetings are crucial for companies, as they are still one of the main means of communication (both in person and remote). Here are 3 good practices you should follow:
  1. Body language
    a. One of the most important aspects in meetings, improving the impression we give to others. "First impressions are made in less than seven seconds and are heavily influenced by your body language". Furthermore, "smiling is a positive signal that is underused by leaders. A smile is an invitation, a sign of welcome and inclusion. It says, 'I’m friendly and approachable'."(Goman, 2018).
    b. "provides clues to your attitude and state of mind" (Pantalone, 2013).
    c. Some (positive) signs to watch out for (Pantalone, 2013):
      i. "Are you using eye contact to include everyone?"
      ii. "Are your arms crossed defensively?"
  2. Asking Questions
    a. "While it may not always be possible or appropriate, meetings tend to work better when the attendees are involved in a conversation rather than simply listening to a long speech. However, some (...) may be reluctant to interject or to volunteer points themselves, which is why questions are so important" (Kan, 2021).
  3. Word choice
    a. "Your choice of words and language in a meeting can sometimes persuade opinions to go in your favor, or do the reverse. Be mindful when choosing your words and avoid language that makes assumptions or discriminates" (Pantalone, 2013).
    b. Endings matter: instead of ending the meeting just by thanking everyone, try to do so on a positive note. For instance, compliment the work of the team, so they leave motivated. Summarizing the contents of the meeting is also helpful to get everyone on the same page. Also, one can finish a meeting with a good question, for instance: "What was an unexpected win from last week?" (Dagher, 2021). This can also be a form of sharing information in a more interactive way.
evaluationQuestions:
  - question: What would be characterized as good body language when joining a meeting? (Consider that you arrive a little early before the meeting started).
    correctAnswers:
      - Arriving with a smile and greeting the people that have already arrived.
    wrongAnswers:
      - Arriving with your arms in a closed position.
      - Arrive silently and sit down immediately.
    feedbackForCorrect: Correct! The best way to join a meeting is by arriving in a positive state-of mind, as happiness spreads fast :). Smiling also helps a lot, although you should not force it. Also, greeting people shows that you are open to have a conversation and to discuss the topics.
    feedbackForWrong: You’ll get it next time! When you arrive to a meeting, try to be more engaging, which is a sign of being open-minded. Arriving silently is only for when you are late, then making no noise is of absolute importance.
  - question: Imagine that you are close to ending a meeting where you just handed out a lot of work to your employees. How would you end your meeting? (Remember what you learned on word choice :) ) (There is more than 1 correct answer).
    correctAnswers:
      - End by summarizing the meeting and wishing everyone luck for the upcoming week.
      - Ask an interesting question at the end of the meeting to try to alleviate the mood.
    wrongAnswers:
      - Finish by saying that the upcoming weeks will be of extra-hard work to motivate the team.
    feedbackForCorrect: That is correct! Ending a meeting should always be done in an active and positive manner. That leaves employees motivated and improves the overall communication.
    feedbackForWrong: No worries, next time is your time to shine! Try to think more about how your employees feel when trying to give them work. Instead of telling them that they have a lot of work to do, try motivating them and show them that you understand their position.
