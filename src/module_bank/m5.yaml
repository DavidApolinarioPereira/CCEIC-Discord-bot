    “Close-ended questions are question formats that provoke a simple response from a respondent. They are designed such there (sic) isn’t much thought into the single word answer”.[1]
    “Individuals generally enjoy talking about themselves. If you give then an opportunity, you'll be surprised how much information they'll disclose to you. However, close-ended questions seek the exact opposite. Rather than seek to hear all they have to say, these questions target specifics.”[2]
